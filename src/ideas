ideas for good coding

- use two stack bases - one for function calls and one for data
- make sure that stack can never override buffers
- write functions that do memory analysis
- circular buffer handler

-----------

TODO
d = needs debugging
x = done

[ ] specify all memory addresses

[d] pkt: capture packet
[ ] pkt: extract data
[d] col: hsv2rgb
[x] led: send byte
[x] led: set whole panel
[x] led: set pixels
[ ] sig: signal processor
[ ] ctl: scan eq board, read values into memory

[ ] main loop

---
[ ] figure out what to do with main interrupt
