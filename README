Cerebro is a system that uses an EEG to measure electromagnetic activity from
the surface of the brain and provide a visual display based on that activity.
The 8051 microprocessor essentially reads data from an EEG device and, though
visualization algorithms, computes a display for a custom-designed LED panel.
Hardware communication was done through UART peripheral chips. Additionally,
the visualization algorithms are customizable through analog slider board
interface. The software was designed to be extremely modular. The main program
calls upon libraries to perform tasks such as grabbing and interpreting data
packets fromt he EEG, reading equalizer slider values, and creating and sending
packets of data out to the lighting system.

Cerebro was my final project for 6.115, a microcontroller class and one of
MIT's most hands-on courses. I'm a big fan of classes that let you do whatever
you want for a final project; it's really amazing to see the creativity that
students have in designing fantastic projects.
